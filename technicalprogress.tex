\section{Technical Progress}

The technical pieces of this project were continued in Project Milestone 5. The activities selected in the activities view of the visualization turn the National Park's that have the activity yellow in the visualization. A black background was added to the yellow circles because feedback from the in-class presentation said the yellow circles were difficult to see especially when overlapped. When the activity is unselected, the National Park's circles that had the activity return to the green shade they were originally. The removal of circles was unable to be implemented in a more direct manner. Documentation about implementing the circles on Leaflet with a model-view-controller scheme were found but it would require a refactoring of the code which was unable to be completed in the remaining time for the project. The removal of circles will be communicated to the participant when performing evaluations. The display view does not display Acadia National Park's information when the month selected changes nor when the clearing of the circles on the map occur. The radius of the National Park was scaled to prevent overlapping when popular months are selected in the month selection. The coloring of the circles was modified to accomodate the feedback from the in-class presentation. The scale was changed such that the most popular National Park's coloring is present and not white.
