Goals:
* The goal is to show visually the popularity (number of people visit those at different times of year) of the national parks. This project tried to combine data (location, number of visitors, activities, weather, costs etc.) for all (sampled as including all is very time consuming) parks. This is important because then people can easily find the parks and select where they want to go according to their choice.
*The goal of the project is to represent exploratory information about national park visiting time in US. She is trying to design a visualization system complying with increasing number of popularity and demand of national parks. The problem is important because there is no visualization work exist for such problem and users can easily extract which time is better to visit in any national park. 
* The initial goal of the project was to create a visually pleasing recommendation system for people who want to visit national parks for different activities which can include cycling, trekking and climbing etc. However, later the project due to time constraint became an exploratory data analysis project in which zoe first herself collected the data and then visualized it along with a large number of filters. The aim of the project is to provide people who are interested in visiting national parks, insights about the parks, what activities are being carried out there and hence making it easy for them to choose their destination. The project is important because there would be a large group of people who would want this information before travelling and this information would be very hard to find in one place, but zoe was able to do that and this is the strength , 
* The goal of the project is to suggest optimal time to the people who want to visit the National Parks in US depending on various factors such as crowd(no. of visitors), weather, activities, distance, cost etc. The visualization that she worked on is trying to accumulate all the data that should be enough to recommend the best time to visit the National Parks in US. This problem is important because there is no website or visualization system where you can find all the data she is providing together. You have to search for different sources for all the data. But this visualization may save a lot of time and it is also easily understandable. 
* Visualize best times and locations to visit national parks. This is important due to overcrowding and it could help protect nature. Additionally, it is useful to find new national parks that the user might not know about.
* The goal of this project is to show an optimal time of year to visit each national park. However, there was no data in one place. Zoe tries to allow users to have a better experience and mitigate overcrowding problems of national parks through the visualization.
* Find the optimal National Parks for passengers. She try to do a visualization on a map that show all National Parks with information. No visualization currently. Having this visualization helps people find which park to go and a better time to visit(decrease crowing). 
* The goal is to find the optimal time to visit national parks. This is important to help users to find parks to go to in order to have a better experience, and mitigate crowds.
* This project helps users have a better experience at National Parks by mitigating overcrowding and help preserve public lands. Specifically, it provides a visualization that shows various information about national parks on a geospatial visualization.
* It is trying to solve the problem of choosing a National Park to visit by helping them identify a park that matches their wants/needs and helps them find lesser known parks. 

Strengths:
* The solution has a a lot of different data attributes the user can look through without overcrowding the display. 
* She provide many filters for different demand, which makes the tool more efficient. she choose different color opacity and size for number of people visit. Both helps(it is a bit less intuitive the size and opacity encoding the same things)
* She provides multiple views and interactions to present complex data. She also put all data in different places together.
* Took data from all over to include cost and activities. Being able to see the cost is very nice and I liked seeing it by month. I also like how convenient it is to see each national park, I would definitely consider using this visualization tool in the future.
* It incorporates a nice variety of data including local weather and nearby attractions like grocery stores and restaurants, not just attractions that are directly in the park. By incorporating temporal data it makes the solution more useful because a park's features might be different depending on the time of year (popularity, weather, available activities) and the tool takes this into account. Coloring the circles to represent the number of people that visit the park each month and scaling them to represent the size of the park was easy to interpret, kept the map simple, and looks nice. 
* The visualization seemed very simple and easy to use to me. It has a pretty simple interface and users can easily find out what they want from this visualization. 
* Strong design study which leverages task taxonomies and design principles we learned in class: Scheniderman (Overview First, Zoom, Details on Demand), Multiple Views, salient encodings for tabular data. The increased sizing of less frequented national park bubbles was very interesting; supports the task very well.
* Interface of the visualization is easy to grasp and provides clever way of representing on demand details within the visualization.
* This is a novel application for the people who want to visit or get to know national parks. Zoe collected information tediously and was able to display it in a decent manner. 
* It gathers the information of the parks together which gives the user a way to compare them easily and take decision based on cost, weather, or other options. It is time-saving. And it uses map which helps in terms of distance and location data. This also let's select monthly data and view them. It has multiple views. Another good thing is activity selection option. As it uses color to show the density (popularity) user can choose less crowded one, or some new one easily.

Suggestions:
* Add another view for showing the saturation data as it was very confusing to try to understand relation between color saturation of circles and size of radius.
* The number of visitors would be better with commas instead of a huge number, and the filter tool seemed to have gaps in it.
* It could be useful to add a juxtapose view to compare to other months or activities to help users to decide the more optimal time. She might also use icons rather than just colors for activity selection highlights.
* The option for activity selection can be made more flexible. As for now it only shows the ones with all the selected activity. But it will be better to show even there is only one of the selected activity. For this there can be multiple views like one view shows all the water activity. Another views showing hiking and others. Another thing is the color choice for popularity can be experimented a bit. As of now it is not very easy to find out which is more dense just by seeing. And as this is shown on map, the white circles might be missed.
* It seems as though more of the data can be encoded directly in the visualization. Much of this interesting data which was compiled is deferred to a summary text box below the visualization. Weather data could be encoded with icons or glyphs perhaps?
* I'm curious if there would be a way to encode number of people per area of the park. A large number of people in a large park would be less crowded than a large number of people in a small park. This might have been in there and I just missed it. I don't know if this data exists, but it'd be nice to be able to see how popular each activity is in a park, especially if an activity isn't allowed at certain times of the year.
* Add a feature that tells the distance from the user's current location to the parks so they know how long it would take to travel. 
* The filter currently show a color for different filter(e.g. yellow). I think using a function that like volume rending would be helpful, which show different option simultaneously. 
* Using multiple colors to represent different activity and feature of a particular location would make the visualization more understandable, and it would allow her to encode more attributes at a time. Also, any textual information over the map would be helpful for people to understand who have little to no knowledge about USA geography (like foreign visitors).
* "1. The yellow color in the map was not very much visible. Specially there were some overlapping yellow circles where I got confused. I don't know whether it is for the saturation or not. But, I think there must be any other way to do this. 

2. She can also use multiple color to denote different activities in the map. Also, some little fancy icons can be used to denote different activities. By doing this, the user will not have to select for multiple activities. The graph can already have the little icons on it denoting the activities. 

3. She can also consider having radio button for (Weather, Activity, Cost etc.). When users select the weather button, the fancy icons denoting different type of weather depending on the weather of the National Parks can appear in the map. For example, if the weather is gonna be sunny, the an icon of a sun can be used or if the weather is gonna be rainy, then an icon of some clouds can be used. Same thing can be done for the other features such as activity, distance etc. "
