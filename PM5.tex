\abstract{
This project will visualize data about the National Parks. The goal is to create a visualization that will allow the user to see the best time of year to visit each National Park. National Parks are a popular destination for many travelers. Over-crowding has become an issue at many National Parks where permits have been incorporated via a lottery system to mitigate dangerous situations from over-crowding. The visualization will include data on the number of visitors at a National Park, the weather, the cost for transportation and lodging and the activities available at each park at any given time of year. The community will be able to learn the best time of year to visit each National Park for the best experience possible.

The contributions for milestone five included completing the visualization, designing and performing evaluations, summarizing and discussing the results from the evaluations, discussing future work and providing a summary of the visualization. An interview was designed and conducted with two participants. The visualization was completed before performing the interviews. An in-class presentation was given to demonstrate and explain the project. The audience was required to fill out a questionnaire about the visualization discussing the goal, problem the visualization solves, the visualization strengths and where it could be improved. These results were compiled and summarized.
